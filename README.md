ENGO500
=======

A repository for our groups' 4th year design project course (ENGO 500) at the University of Calgary

The purpose of the project is for a group of students to get hands on experience in working in an engineering environment on a full design project. The particular focus of this project is about the concept of the "Internet of Things." In particular, this project will be focused on developing a "smart shelf" that can track customers and customer purchases or interests throughout a grocery store. The project, which will be developed as Free, Open-Source Software (FOSS) hopes to serve as an example for developers looking to develop an IoT application using the Open Geospatial Consortium standard, which is currently in draft, but should be published by the end of 2013 or early 2014. This project also hopes to serve as a stand alone product that can be hacked or improved upon for a variety of different applications. 

Currently no software is available through the repository, but more will be made available as development advances over the course of the academic year (September 2013 - April 2014).
