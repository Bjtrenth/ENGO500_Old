*shelf facing

Stores often arrange their stock as specified in a planogram, which acts as a map for their products on their shelves. However, planning out how to arrange the products is one matter -- ensuring that products are in the correct locations and maintain an organized appearance is another matter. This task is often very labour-intensive and time-consuming. In order to address this problem, Intel has developed an intelligent shelf compliance solution. The solution is a robot named AndyVision, which navigates the aisles of the store using sonar technology and uses a Microsoft Kinect as eyes to check the shelves. The collected images can wirelessly alert staff when stock is low and if items are disorganized or misplaced. These images, once processed, can also help staff identify product placement issues (e.g. if a product has been allocated too much or too little space). While the research project prototype was a robot, a typical retail deployment might consider using existing cameras or installing miniature cameras on the sides of shopping carts, as a robot might inconvenience shoppers during opening hours. [Intel]

The main goal of monitoring shelf facing is to be able to alert staff as to whether or not a shelf is faced, so that if it is not, an employee can remedy the situation. In order to reduce some of this time-consuming work, stores sometimes use shelves which have tracks, dividers and springs to automatically organize products, pushing them to the front of the shelf. These are available in different sizes to accommodate different types of stock. [shelf]


*Retail Analytics

Currently, there are two main ways in which retailers collect data about traffic in stores - using video or using cell phone signals. These two ways have been researched and implemented because it typically requires little additional hardware setup. Most stores already have an existing set of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras in their stores, and nowadays most customers carry cell phones with them while they shop. Leveraging the existing technology is a common strategy employed by several commercial companies and research groups. Some specific examples of both cases are discussed here.

As mentioned, most stores are already equipped video cameras throughout the store, in order to track suspicious behaviour and have resources for offline investigation if any theft occurs. However, having people monitoring surveillance cameras can be quite inefficient, as it requires a lot of time and some events (particularly in larger facilities) could go unnoticed. Hence, having some kind of automatic detection or monitoring systems can be useful. As developed and tested by [peopletrack1], the video recordings can be augmented with various algorithms to help real-time monitoring of stores. For example, people can be tracked as they enter or leave the store, including what they carry with them when they enter. This is useful information to help with returns fraud, where people take new items and return them without having actually purchased them. In [peopletrack2], video cameras are used to understand the shopping behaviour of customers. For example, they use various detection algorithms to determine if a shopper should be classified as goal-oriented or disoriented based on their walking speed. In addition, they detected facial expressions and interactions with objects.

There are also some commercial solutions available for gathering and communicating retail analytics. One commercial service is called ShopperTrak, which offers a variety of solutions for retailers to understand key questions about their consumers. This includes questions such as is my marketing effective? and which zones attract the most traffic?. [ShopperTrak]. This service again leverages video camera technology and also uses mobile analytics from cellular phones. 

Another commercial solution is Path Intelligence, which also has a variety services such as location usage analysis using interactive heat maps, signage effectiveness reports, flow management analysis and dwell time reports. All of these services help retailers understand their customers better. Path Intelligence uses the strength of cell phone signals in order to triangulate a location for each customer. While the locations are known, the identity of each consumer remains anonymous. [PathIntel]

Other retail analytics companies also use cell phones in order to track shopper movements, but they use MAC addresses instead of cell phone signals sent to cell towers. If a phone is Bluetooth or WiFi-enabled, it will broadcast its own MAC address in order to communicate with other devices. Based on detection of MAC addresses belonging to each device, their locations can be determined. Aggregate reports formed from this data provide insight into current waiting times at cashiers, optimized store location and consumer shopping patterns. [MLAC]
		

*Sensor Servers*

In order to be able to communicate with different sensors simultaneously, a sensor server is typically used. There are several types of existing sensor servers which have been marketed commercially. Some of them are only able to interface with certain sensors, such as the PCW-SSRX Sensor Server made by SenSource [SenSource]. This server communicates specifically with proprietary wireless sensors equipped with radio frequency transmitters, or wired sensors. From one or more servers, information can be communicated to a central PC, which can query the server using proprietary Server Manager Software or by simple ASCII commands. 

Another sensor server has been created by Oracle, which is well-known for its database management systems. The Oracle Sensor Edge Server integrates data from different sensors, which includes RFID, temperature sensors, humidity sensors and others, as well as command/response-type equipment. It is the middle-tier component which communicates between these objects and applications. [oracle]
