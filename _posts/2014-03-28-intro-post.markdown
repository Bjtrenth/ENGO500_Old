Hi everyone!

This first blog post is just a quick introduction to what this blog is about. For our final-year capstone design project, we were tasked to create an application of the Internet of Things (also known as the IoT). We decided to create a "smart shelf" -- except "smart" things are overdone nowadays, so we decided to call it LASS - a Location Aware Shelf System.

You can find details regarding the prototype development for our shelf, as well as other general project documents on the [ENGO500](https://github.com/ThatGeoGuy/ENGO500) repository and details about the website development can be likewise be found in the [ENGO500-Webserver](https://github.com/ThatGeoGuy/ENGO500-Webserver) repository. 

For the purposes of making other blog posts, I will also add some additional random objects below, for formatting purposes. 

> This is a blockquote. **This part is bold.** *This should be italicized.*

## This is a level 2 heading
### This is a level 3 heading 

    You can write sample code here

* This is an unordered list element.
* And a second one just for kicks.

1. This is an ordered list element
2. Again, a second one

This is the last paragraph of this blog post
