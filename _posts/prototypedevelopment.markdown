##Equipment 
For the prototype we used two Raspberry pi's, 2 Photo interrupters and 2 PIR motion sensors. We connected 1 photo interrupter and 1 PIR motion sensor to each raspberry pi. 

For the purposes of this project, the photo interrupter was used in order to check for shelf facing and the PIR motion sensor is used to detect customer movement.
