The OGC SensorThings API has a general data model, designed to be adaptable to any IoT application. This post will discuss the components of the data model which we deemed relevant for our project, and how these components were used in our application. For more details regarding other applications, please see the full documentation on the [OGC IoT data model page](http://ogc-iot.github.io/ogc-iot-api/datamodel.html).

As you can see in the figure below, we have highlighted the entities in the data model which were the most crucial for our application.
